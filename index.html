<body>
    <!--  1. Create a folder in local system
          2. Open the folder in cmd
          3. Then type in "code ." to open the directory in vs code.
          4. The git should be initialized in the local system, so use "git init" comand to create an empty local repo.
             Create some files that need to be added for the repo like the project structure or something like that, then add those files or required files to the
             "staging area" by using "git add filename or git add . " as the command.
          6. Then check if they have been added to the staging area or not, then commit the changes to the local repo, by using the command 
             "git commit -m "message" "
          7. Then create the global repo in the github, name the repo as the folder name and make it public or pivate as needed, add any 
             ReadMe file if needed then create the repo.
          8. Then to link the global and local repo , you have to copy paste the code lines (3 lines ) in the bottom of the page that opens
             after the creation of repo un github.
          9. Then the code committed to the local repo will be linked to the global repo and the files will be visible(saved) in the github.
        All this process shoul be done only if the repo is created for the first time locally and globally.
        
        when the repo is already created none of this is reqired :)
